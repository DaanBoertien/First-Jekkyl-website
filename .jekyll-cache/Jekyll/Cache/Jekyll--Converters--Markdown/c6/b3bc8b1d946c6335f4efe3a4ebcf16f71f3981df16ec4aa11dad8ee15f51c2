I"—<p>As I indicated earlier, I will be adding this to my list of recordings where the pianist has something distinctive to say. In this, Boertien joins the illustrious company of the likes of Britten and AdÃ¨s in his recent revelatory live version with Bostridge. Boertien is a similarly endless source of delight. Even the seemingly plain spun figurations of Die Post are coloured with consummate care under his fingers. Listen to the ache he finds in the arching melody of TÃ¤uschung â€“ not too much but just enough. This ability to judge the fine gradations of emotion transforms what look like very few notes on the page into a penetrating musical vision.</p>
